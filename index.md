## Dominant Crowdfunding

Dominant assurance contracts are like a souped-up, more powerful version of Kickstarter. It's crowdfunding, but with the twist of a *refund bonus*. People pledge money to a project like a normal crowdfund, but if it fails to reach its goal amount, then not only is their money returned to them, but they get a bonus percentage that is proportional to the amount that they pledged. This comes from the project creator staking a sum of money on the success of the project, that gets paid out as the refund bonus if it fails. This incentivizes the project creator to not make a crowdfund more expensive than necessary. It also incentivizes people to pledge to these crowdfunds more frequently! Experiments showed crowdfunds using this mechanism can be twice as effective at raising funds.

They were originally proposed in a paper by Alex Tabarrok, [a paper by Alex Tabarrok](https://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/PrivateProvision.pdf). Here is a [recent talk](https://foresight.org/salon/dominant-assurance-contracts-alex-tabarrok-george-mason-university/) by Tabarrok on the subject, hosted by the Foresight Institute.
