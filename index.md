## Game-Theoretically Dominant Crowdfunding

Dominant assurance contracts are like a souped-up, more powerful version of Kickstarter. They were originally proposed in Alex Tabarrok's paper,[The private provision of public goods via dominant assurance contracts](https://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/PrivateProvision.pdf). Here is a [recent talk](https://foresight.org/salon/dominant-assurance-contracts-alex-tabarrok-george-mason-university/) by Tabarrok on the subject, hosted by the Foresight Institute.

## Topics to Add

- Why Blockchain Is The Way To Go For Scaling Human Coordination (probably should be a LessWrong post)
- A case study into Why GroupOn Missed "The Point"
- Different applications for dominant assurance contracts, including starting new cities or moving as a group to them, with the Free State Project's assurance contract as a case study (would be cool to interview the creator of that).
- Research whether it makes sense to build "the dominant crowdfunding platform", perhaps on Solana?
- How [impact certificates](www.impactcertificates.com) can be involved.
- Repost whatever's relevant from Balaji Srinivisan
- Musings on how local public goods could be produced for city DAOs using dominant assurance contracts, quadratic funding, and community currencies (e.g. [CityCoins](citycoincs.co)).
